Optimize data for real time?
How all this information shoul efficiently be stored and accessed? Liked data, representations, list, hash table
How all this information are prioritiesd for functionnin robot? Stacks ques and storting
How all this information are used for robot navigation? trees graphs (machine learning and AI)
How all thes are done in real time? algorithmic analysis

Big Picture Guiding Questions
Does it work
Can we do better
- optimizing running time and number of operation scales 
- this is done by the size of the input
- measure of the runtime thats independent of harware, programmin language
