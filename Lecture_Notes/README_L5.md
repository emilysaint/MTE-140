## Big "O" notation
- grade school mulilicatoon
    - how efficient is this algorithim
    - how many single-didgit operations
    - O(n<sup>2</sup>)
- describes the complexity of your code using algebraic terms
- therunning time/number of operations that independent of hardware programming language
